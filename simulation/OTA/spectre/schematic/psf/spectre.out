Notice from spectre during topology check.
    Only one connection to the following 2 nodes:
        v+
        v-
    No DC path from node `v+' to ground, Gmin installed to provide path.
    No DC path from node `v-' to ground, Gmin installed to provide path.
Warning from spectre during heuristic topology check - set topcheck=fixall to fix all floating nodes.
    WARNING (SPECTRE-7): No DC path from node `vdd!' to ground.
    WARNING (SPECTRE-7): No DC path from node `gnd!' to ground.
