Begin Netlisting Nov 29 15:26:10 2018
WARNING (OSSHNL-143): Incremental netlisting is not possible since the global
map file
'/home/seas/jwcrandall/cadence/simulation/Mini_Frame_trial2_V0_tb/ams/config/netlist/digital/ihnl/globalmap', could
not be opened in the read mode for IHNL
version number comparison. Therefore
re-netlisting the entire design.

INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/home/seas/jwcrandall/cadence/simulation/Mini_Frame_trial2_V0_tb/ams/config/netlist/digital/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name mapped
table, set 
simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or the
.simrc file 
before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
